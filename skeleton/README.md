# Homework 0: Circular Buffers

You will implement a ring buffer and a FIR Filter in order to refresh your memory on C programming and get introduced to some Digital Signal Processing concepts. Write your code in `ring.c`. Refer to `hw00.pdf` for the full specification.

## Deadline

This assignment is due Tuesday, Feb 1 at 11:59 PM. Be sure to push *all* of your code to this repository before the deadline. This is an *individual assignment*, so you may not collaborate or share code with other students.

## Using `git`

Remember to keep your repository history clean, with many small commits and descriptive commit messages. We want to be able to see the progression of your thoughts through the commit log, **not** just a single commit with all your code (and this will be reflected in your grade).

For the most part, the following commands will be all you need:
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git status` (*always* use this before committing)
  - `git diff -stat`
  - `git push`
  - `git pull`
  - `git clone`

  You can learn about each of these using the internet, or `git help X` where `X` is the command portion of the above examples.
